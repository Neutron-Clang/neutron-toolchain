# This Repository is archived due to migration to the new release system

Neutron Clang has completed the transition to the new release system long ago, This commit deprecates this repository, So users can directly use [AntMan](https://github.com/Neutron-Toolchains/antman.git) to sync builds. 

### Information about new release approach:
The new release approach would instead push binaries as tarballs to our [catalogue repository](https://github.com/Neutron-Toolchains/clang-build-catalogue)'s [release section](https://github.com/Neutron-Toolchains/clang-build-catalogue/releases/) rather than straight to this repository.

The new approach also makes use of our very own toolchain manager, [AntMan](https://github.com/Neutron-Toolchains/antman.git) (A Nonsensical Toolchain Manager). AntMan can be used to download/sync toolchain builds, update them, and manage them.

To learn how to utilise AntMan, follow the link below:
[Here's how to use AntMan](https://github.com/Neutron-Toolchains/clang-build-catalogue#how-to-install).
